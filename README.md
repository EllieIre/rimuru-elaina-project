This code is a C++ project that I made for my school project. This code is a game that we as the player are requested to move Rimuru Tempest through the obstacles and meet with Elaina.

*(yes, this code is intended to be a pun of "That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime" and "Wandering Witch: The Journey of Elaina" crossover.)*
